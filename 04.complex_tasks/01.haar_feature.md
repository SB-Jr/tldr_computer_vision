# Haar Feature Extraction

**Haar-like features** are [digital image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image "Digital image") [features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(computer_vision) "Feature (computer vision)") used in [object recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_recognition "Object recognition"). They owe their name to their intuitive similarity with [Haar wavelets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_wavelet "Haar wavelet") and were used in the first real-time face detector.
