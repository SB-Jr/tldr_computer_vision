# Image Preprocessing

Often an input image is pre-processed to normalize contrast and brightness effects. A very common preprocessing step is to **subtract the mean of image intensities and divide by the standard deviation**. 

Sometimes, **gamma correction** produces slightly better results. While dealing with color images, a **color space transformation** ( e.g. RGB to LAB color space ) may help get better results.
