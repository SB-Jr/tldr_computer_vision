# Feature Extraction

Feature Extraction algorithms can be categorized into 3 categories

- **Statistical Features**
- **Global Transformation and Series Expansion Features**: These are invariant to global deformations like translation and rotation.
  - Fourier Transform
  - Rapid Transform
  - Hough Transform
  - Gabor Transform
  - Wavelets
  - Moments
- **Geometric and Topological Features**:  These features may represent global and local properties of characters and have high tolerances to distortions and style variations. These topological features may encode some knowledge about the contour of the object or may require some knowledge as to what sort of components make up that object.

## Edge Detection

We can characheterize an edge as a point in image where brightness changes sharply or a discontinuity is present.

Many algorithms exis

- Gradient Filtering using Sobel filters 
- Gradient Filtering using Laplacian kernel
- Canny Edge detection

## Corner Detection

Mainly used for object detection, motion detection, video tracking. A corner is defined as a junction where edges intersect.

- Harris corner Detection
- Shi and Tomasi corner Detection
